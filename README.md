A collection of things that look interesting.

n.b. I have not necessarily used these libraries, tools or techniques - this repository is a place where I can collect these to investigate later on.

## JavaScript

### Errors

* [ono](https://github.com/James-Messinger/ono) - supports wrapping errors, etc.

### ES6 Modules

* [babel-plugin-transform-named-imports](https://github.com/SectorLabs/babel-plugin-transform-named-imports) - allows for better tree shaking; see [this thread](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1023309788246167552) for more context
